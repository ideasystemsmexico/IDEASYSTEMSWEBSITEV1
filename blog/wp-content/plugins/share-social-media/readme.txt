Add social sharing icons to a post or page of your WordPress website and allow visitors to share your content on various social media sites.

== Description ==

**Social Icons Sticky** plugin adds social media sharing icons to a WordPress site. The plugin adds social share icons to posts or pages of your WordPress website and allows visitors to share the content of a post or page on various social media sites. It automatically picks the featured image, post title, and meta description for sharing depending on the social media. You can choose which social icons to enable. It supports multiple icon placement positions. You can place social icons before and after the page/post content. Also, you can place sticky icons on the right or left side of your WordPress site.

Social sharing icons are a crucial aspect of WordPress website design, SEO, and functionality. They allow users to easily share content from your website on their own social media profiles. This can result in increased website traffic, interaction, and, ultimately, brand awareness.

Furthermore, including social sharing icons on your website can help to improve your search engine optimization, visibility, and reach of your website, as well as your online presence and reputation.
